It provides the essential orchestration layer to make your agents observable, reliable, and safe.</p> <p>In the rapidly evolving world of AI agents, many frameworks focus on rapid prototyping. AgentHelm is different. It's built on the premise that for agents to be trusted in real-world, production environments, they need the same level of observability and control as traditional software.</p> <p>If you've ever struggled to debug a failing agent or worried about deploying an agent that interacts with real-world systems, AgentHelm is for you.</p>"},{"location":"#key-features","title":"Key Features","text":"<ul> <li>Traceable Execution: Automatically log every tool call, its inputs, outputs, errors, and execution time.

It asks the LLM to decide on the single next best action.</li> <li>Act: The agent parses the LLM's response, which includes the tool to use and the arguments to use it with. It then uses the <code>ExecutionTracer</code> to execute that tool.</li> <li>Observe: The result of the tool execution (the \"observation\") is added to the history.</li> <li>Repeat: The loop repeats, feeding the new observation back into the LLM for the next reasoning step.</li> </ol> <p>This loop continues until the LLM decides the task is complete and calls the special <code>finish</code> tool.</p>"},{"location":"concepts/#the-event-model","title":"The Event Model","text":"<p>Every action in AgentHelm is recorded as an <code>Event</code>.

The <code>ExecutionTracer</code> implements several key features to make agents more robust:</p> <ul> <li>Human-in-the-Loop (<code>requires_approval</code>): You can mark any tool as requiring human approval. The tracer will pause execution and wait for confirmation before proceeding.</li> <li>Retries: For tools that might be flaky (e.g., due to network issues), you can specify a number of retries. The tracer will automatically re-run the tool on failure.</li> <li>Rollbacks (<code>compensating_tool</code>): You can link a tool to a \"compensating\" tool that can undo its action. If a step in a multi-step workflow fails, the <code>Agent</code> will instruct the <code>Tracer</code> to execute the compensating tools for all previously completed steps in reverse order, ensuring the system doesn't get left in an inconsistent state.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tutorial/","title":"Tutorial","text":"<p>This tutorial will walk you through building a complete agent with AgentHelm, from simple tools to complex, multi-step workflows with rollbacks.</p> <p>Coming soon...</p>"}]}
